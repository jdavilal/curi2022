"# curi2022: Dissolvo, an accurate method for estimating mutational signature contributions" 
The Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) contains a curated set of mutational signatures generated from thousands of cancer patients. Different signatures are associated with unique mutational processes, for example, COSMIC SBS4 mutational signature is associated with tobacco smoking and is characterized by an abundance of C>A mutations. We are interested in estimating the contribution of a prescribed number of mutational signatures for a given sample. To solve this problem we proposed a method, dissolvo, based on linear regression with constraints. The constraints correspond to quantile information curated by COSMIC for each represented signature and cancer type. We found that the correlation between Dissolvoâ€™s output and the true proportion of sample profiles is 95% and the mean squared error (MSE) is 0.003. The correlation between Dissolvo and fit_to_signatures, a comparable method, is 99%. In conclusion, we provide an R function, Dissolvo, to estimate mutational signature contribution.
